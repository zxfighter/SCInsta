# Support the project
SCInsta takes a lot of time to develop, as the Instagram app is ever-changing and difficult to keep up with. Additionally, I'm still a student which doesn't leave me much time to work on this tweak.

If you'd like to support my work, you can donate to my [ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/socuul)!\
There's many other ways to support this project however, by simply sharing a link to this tweak with others who would like it!

Seeing people use this tweak is what keeps me motivated to keep working on it ‚ù§Ô∏è
